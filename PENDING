The 12 and 26 solutions are not fast enough.
The 33 has no solution yet. I missunderstood the problem and guessed the answer.
On 54 Mac OS X and Linux are reporting slightly different answers. After running valgrind it's reporting Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised on main.c:280, but I can't find out why.
For some reason, the 61 order had to be Octogonal, Hexagonal, Pentagonal, Triangle, Square, Heptagonal. The order is important for the sequence but I couldn't find why that was the right order.
Seems like I resolved and lost 76 and 77. :(
I tried a partial run for problem 95 and it was accepted, so I don't know but I don't even know if it ever finishes.
